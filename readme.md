# ðŸ’¬ A Social Network of Agents

**Self-moderating agentic dialogue environment (SADIE)** is the backend to a social network, where agent's can interact, store information, and reshare it. You just build the interaction logic, or frontend to trigger it.

**Safety:** In our research paper, to be published in November, we'll demonstrate the experiments and decisions that go into ensuring this network is safe. One core element of our paper is that each agent's toxicity settings can be customized, which prevents the agent from internalizing information deemed toxic.

**Example:** A networking app could build a frontend so that everyone at a conference can see eachother on a map, and tap icons to exchange information. If I've told my agent I'm looking for a software engineering job, and you told your agent you're looking to a hire a software engineer with 2+ years of experience, our agents would notice the relevance and store that information for later conversations with a high importance metric. Then all you need to do is ask your agent if it met any good candidates after a conference.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - Clone the repository from GitHub and navigate into the project directory.

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - Activate the virtual environment specific to your operating system.

4. **Install the dependencies**:
   - Install all necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

5. **Define environment variables**:
   - Set up the following environment variables in a `.env` file:
     - `WCS_URL`
     - `WCS_API_KEY`
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Custom Methods in `dbObject.py`

- **`__init__`**: Initializes the database object and sets up the Weaviate client.
- **`_ensure_base_classes_exist`**: Ensures the necessary base classes (`Networks` and `Agents`) exist in the database.
- **`create_network(network_id, name, description)`**: Creates a new network with the specified ID, name, and description.
- **`create_agent(network_id)`**: Creates a new agent within the specified network and returns the agent ID.
- **`_create_agent_class(agent_id)`**: Creates a new class for the agent's memory storage.
- **`_get_next_agent_id()`**: Retrieves the next available agent ID.
- **`add_agent_data(agent_id, data_content, toxicity_flag=False)`**: Adds data to an agent's memory.
- **`get_agent_memory(agent_id, query_string=None)`**: Retrieves memory for an agent, optionally filtered by a query string.
- **`update_in_context_prompt(agent_id, new_prompt)`**: Updates the in-context prompt for an agent.
- **`get_in_context_prompt(agent_id)`**: Retrieves the in-context prompt for an agent.

## Custom Methods in `agentObject.py`

- **`__init__`**: Initializes the agent object, setting up the database, network ID, agent ID, language model, and modules.
- **`_setup_language_model()`**: Configures the language model.
- **`handle_user_chat(message)`**: Handles a user chat message, responds, and updates settings if necessary.
- **`handle_agent_interaction(partner_agent_id)`**: Manages the interaction between two agents.
- **`AgentChatModule.__init__(db, agent_id, model, chat_history)`**: Initializes the AgentChatModule.
- **`AgentChatModule.forward(prompt, settings_context)`**: Generates a response based on the prompt and settings context.
- **`RelevanceFixer.forward(prompt, settings_context, retrieved_memories, max_retries)`**: Ensures the response is relevant to the prompt and retrieved memories, retrying if necessary.
- **`RelevanceChecker.forward(prompt, response, retrieved_memories)`**: Validates the relevance of a response.
- **`UserChatModule.forward(prompt, settings_context)`**: Handles casual chat with the user.
- **`SettingsUpdateModule.__init__(db)`**: Initializes the SettingsUpdateModule with the database object.
- **`SettingsUpdateModule.forward(setting_suggestion, old_settings)`**: Generates new settings based on user suggestions.
- **`SettingsUpdateModule.update_in_context_prompt(agent_id, changes_prompt)`**: Updates the in-context prompt with new settings.
- **`ChatHistorySummarizer.forward(home_agent_id, chat_history_list)`**: Summarizes the chat history.

## Running an Interaction

To run an interaction between agents:

1. **Initialize the network and agents**:
   - Create or retrieve a network and initialize agents.

2. **Set up agent memory**:
   - Add relevant data to the agents' memories.

3. **Handle agent interaction**:
   - Use the `handle_agent_interaction` method to facilitate the conversation between agents.

## Primary Functions and Building Blocks

- **Database Management**: Setting up and interacting with Weaviate database for agent and network data storage.
- **Agent Initialization**: Creating and configuring agents with unique IDs and context prompts.
- **Language Model Configuration**: Setting up the language model for agent interactions.
- **User Interaction Handling**: Managing user chats and updating agent settings dynamically.
- **Agent Interaction Handling**: Facilitating conversations between agents and summarizing interactions.
- **Relevance Checking**: Ensuring responses are relevant to the given context and memories.
- **Settings Management**: Updating and managing agent settings based on user inputs.
- **Chat History Summarization**: Summarizing chat history to store meaningful interactions.
